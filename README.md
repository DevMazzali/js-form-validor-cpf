# JavaScript Form Validation with CPF Validator

A demonstration of clean, vanilla JavaScript form validation techniques featuring custom validation algorithms and structured front-end architecture. This project showcases proficiency in client-side development patterns and real-world validation implementation.

## Technical Highlights

- **Custom Validation Logic**: Hand-coded CPF (Brazilian tax ID) validation algorithm demonstrating understanding of complex business rules
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated validation modules
- **DOM Manipulation**: Efficient JavaScript for real-time user feedback and form state management
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Pure vanilla JavaScript without framework dependencies
- **Code Organization**: Professional file structure and naming conventions

## Algorithm Implementation

### CPF Validation Algorithm
The core feature demonstrates implementation of the Brazilian CPF (Cadastro de Pessoas FÃ­sicas) validation algorithm, which involves:

**Two-Step Verification Process:**
1. **First Check Digit Calculation** [web:5][web:6]
   - Multiply the first 9 digits by weights (10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2)
   - Sum all products
   - Apply modular arithmetic: `(sum * 10) % 11`
   - Handle edge cases where remainder equals 10 or 11 (converted to 0)

2. **Second Check Digit Calculation** [web:5][web:6]
   - Multiply the first 10 digits by weights (11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2)
   - Apply same modular arithmetic rules
   - Validate against the final digit

**Edge Case Handling:**
- Invalid CPFs with all identical digits (111.111.111-11, etc.) [web:5]
- Proper format validation (XXX.XXX.XXX-XX pattern)
- Checksum verification using the official Ministry of Finance algorithm [web:5]

**Mathematical Foundation:**
The algorithm uses weighted sum calculations with modular arithmetic to generate check digits, similar to ISBN-10 validation systems [web:11]. This ensures mathematical integrity and prevents common data entry errors.
